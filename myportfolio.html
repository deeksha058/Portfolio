          released the song 'Aadat' with another contemporary 
          musician Goher Mumtaz in 2003. The original version 
          was written by Goher and sung by Aslam. During this 
          initial period of the band, Aslam was the lead singer
           of Jal. He has mentioned in multiple interviews that
            he had recorded the song with his pocket money at the
             age of 17. The band released the song on the internet
              in 2003, which then went on to become a youth anthem.

 Ghafoor, having 11 tracks, which was an instant 
 hit.[21][22] The album also won the 4th Lux Style
